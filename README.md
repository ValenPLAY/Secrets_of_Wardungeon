# Unity3d-Dungeon-Generator
A procedural dungeon generator for Unity3d

The code is provided as is (and is kinda gross), use it however you like.
I can not offer too much support, but feel free to shoot questions at my twitter @DMeville or email info@dylanmeville.com and I'll try my best

See a video of this generator in action here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YXoq12Devw
And a write up explaining how it works (at a high level) here: http://blog.elysianlegends.com/?p=11

Have fun! ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ
